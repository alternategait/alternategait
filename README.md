### Hi! I'm Brandi.

I'm a software engineer at 100Devs familiar with JavaScipt, Node.js, React, Express, MongoDB, semantic HTML, restAPIs and more. 

I have always wanted to work in a position that helps people. Along the way, I found that I also seek out opportunities to problem solve with creative and novel solutions.
