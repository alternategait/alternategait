# Hi! I'm Brandi.

I'm a software engineer at 100Devs familiar with JavaScipt, Node.js, React, Express, MongoDB, semantic HTML, restAPIs and more. 

I have always wanted to work in a position that helps people. Along the way, I found that I also seek out opportunities to problem solve with creative and novel solutions.

### Fun Facts

🧶 I'm a crafter mostly making things with crochet. I've made several blankets for friends and family, but will never sell my work. 
💃 Partner dancing is my favorite hobby. 
🏋️‍♀️ I'm a licensed physical therapist.
🐈 All my cats (3) know tricks including "stand up", "high five", "turn around", and "pedestal". I have a dog too.
