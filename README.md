# Hi! I'm Brandi.

I'm a software engineer and accessibility specialist familiar with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, JavaScipt, Node.js, React, Express, MongoDB, semantic HTML, restAPIs and more. 

I have always wanted to work in a position that helps people. Along the way, I found that I also seek out opportunities to problem solve with creative and novel solutions.

### Fun Facts

🧶 I'm a crafter mostly making things with crochet. I've made several blankets for friends and family, but will never sell my work. 

💃 Partner dancing is my favorite hobby. 

🏋️‍♀️ I'm a licensed physical therapist.

🐈 All my cats (3) know tricks including "stand up", "high five", "turn around", and "pedestal". I have a [dog](https://github.com/alternategait/QuinnFiles#readme) too.

## What I'm working on
[![GitHub Streak](https://github-readme-streak-stats.herokuapp.com?user=alternategait&theme=buefy)](https://git.io/streak-stats)

Working to build skills in JavaScript and MERN stack to create beautiful, useful and functional websites. A big project is in the works for families and caregivers of people requring physical assistance for daily activities. 

## Some projects I'm proud of
